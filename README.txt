- All code is written in Python.
- To run the code, you will require Python3
- Required packages: numpy, scikit-learn, pytables, pandas
- The datasets are within this folder with the '.data' extension. (cancer.data and adult.data)
- The code files are as follows:
	- KNN.py
	- SVM.py
	- ANN.py
	- Boosting.py
	- Decision Tree.py
	- helpers.py
	- parse_data.py (It has already been compiled. No need to run in order to test.)
- To run the code, you first run helpers.py using the 'python helpers.py' command in the terminal.
- After that you can run any algorithm of your choice Eg: 'python KNN.py'
- The output will be generated in the output folder.
